    If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen

    it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs,
    P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.

    The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance
    of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five
    blue discs and thirty-five red discs.

    By finding the first arrangement to contain over
