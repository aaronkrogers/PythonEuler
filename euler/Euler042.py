    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1);

    alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value.
    For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10.
    If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word
    a triangle word.
